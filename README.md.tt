# Ansible Playbook

## Configure

Just remember to change the `HOSTNAME` to an actual hostname of a machine you'd like configured:

```
vi site.yml
```

Then you just use `ansible-playbook` to provision that machine.

```
ansible-playbook site.yml
```

Note:  You will also need to add this host to your inventory in some way (I find this step annoying...)

```
vi /etc/ansible/hosts
```


## Hints

To run only roles you're currently developing (by default, the java role is setup this way):

```
ansible-playbook site.yml --tags current -vvvvv
```
